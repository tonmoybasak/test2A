Factory pattern is one of the most used design patterns in Java. In Factory pattern, we create object without exposing the creation logic to the client and refer to newly created object using a common interface.
                                                                 
We will create a Vehicle interface and classes implementing that interface. A factory class VehicleFactory is defined.

VehicleFactoryDemo, our demo class will use VehicleFactory to get a Vehicle object. It will pass information to VehicleFactory to get the type of object it needs.
